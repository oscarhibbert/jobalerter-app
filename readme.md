# Telegram Job Alerter

A Python application that regularly monitors for new job vacancies added to a companyâ€™s careers page based on a specific search term. 

Company careers page URLs to monitor are managed in Airtable & checked by the application.

The application then sends an alert for any new vacancies to a private Telegram channel when detected.
